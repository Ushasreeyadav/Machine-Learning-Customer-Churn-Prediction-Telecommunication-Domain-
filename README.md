# Machine-Learning-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Telecommunication-Domain-
In this project, by using a set of ML algorithms, a computational intelligence approach is applied to predict  whether a customer will churn or not, based on the given features.
The classification analysis of this dataset followed the steps of data splitting, pre-processing, Fitting the classification models, and evaluation.
The resultant outcome revealed that Logistic Regression achieved highest accuracy score.
